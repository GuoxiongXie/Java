# Java

We have a new Java library for anyone who needs to calculate sales tax and prefers to work with Java on the server side. We call it ‘TaxCloud.java’ and you can use it purely as a library of TaxCloud-specific API calls integrated with your shopping cart to determine sales tax due (based upon your customer’s address) before you send a total purchase amount to your purchasing platform.

For more information, please visit https://taxcloud.net/java/

Thank you!
